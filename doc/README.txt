An InfiniMiner/Minecraft inspired game.

This is a development version:
- Don't expect it to work as well as a finished game will.
- Please report any bugs to me. That way I can fix them to the next release.

Server information:
- I usually have a server running at celer.oni.biz on port 30000
- If you want to run a server, I can list you on my website and in here.

Features, as of now:
- Almost Infinite Map (limited to +-31000 blocks in any direction at the moment)
    - Minecraft alpha has a height restriction of 128 blocks
- Map Generator capable of taking advantage of the infinite map

Controls:
- WASD+mouse: Move
- Mouse L: Dig
- Mouse R: Place block
- Mouse Wheel: Change item
- F: Change item
- R: Toggle full view range

Configuration file:
- Can be passed as parameter to the executable.
- If not given as parameter, these are checked, in order:
	../minetest.conf
	../../minetest.conf

Running on Windows:
- The working directory should be ./bin

Running on GNU/Linux:
- fasttest is a linux binary compiled on a recent Arch Linux installation.
  It should run on most recent GNU/Linux distributions.
- Browse to the game ./bin directory and type:
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./fasttest
- If it doesn't work, use wine. I aim at 100% compatibility with wine.
